PITTSBURGH, July  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., (the “Company” or “Cognition”) (NASDAQ: CGTX), a clinical-stage company developing drugs that treat neurodegenerative disorders, published results of a proteomics analysis from the Phase 2 ‘SEQUEL’ COG0202 Study of zervimesine (CT1812) in adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The manuscript, titledIdentification of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers and Molecular Correlates of Brain Activity in a Phase 2 Clinical Trial of the Alzheimer’s Disease Drug Candidate, CT1812, was published in the peer-reviewed journalAlzheimer’s & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions.SEQUEL was a single-site study that investigated the effect of zervimesine on synaptic function using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), a noninvasive technique to measure electrical activity of the brain.
In the SEQUEL study (NCT04735536),zervimesinetreatment resulted in consistent trends of improvement across all prespecified EEG parameters, including the prominence of certain EEG frequencies associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Slower frequencies termed “theta” waves were reduced after 29 days of zervimesine treatment compared to placebo. This suggests zervimesine may normalize the function of neurons and synapses.
Additionally, zervimesine treatment was associated with an improvement in global alpha AEC-c, a measure of functional connectivity, suggesting zervimesine may be facilitating communication between brain regions. Analysis was performed to identify proteins associated with zervimesine’s normalizing effect on AEC-c. Proteins that were significantly altered with zervimesine treatment compared to placebo were associated with vesicle formation, exocytosis and endosomal trafficking. These key cellular functions allow neurons to recycle and eject cellular debris, and transport cargo needed for cellular function.
“These recycling and transport functions are necessary for the normal operation of any cell,” explainedMary Hamby, PhD, Cognition Therapeutics’ VP of research. “Our analysis from the SEQUEL study shows zervimesine has the ability to preserve the health and function of neurons that are under stress in Alzheimer’s disease. We delved into this neuroprotective function in a series ofin vitroexperiments that used an oxidative stressor to mimic neurodegenerative disease conditions. We showed zervimesine preserves the health and function of neurons – not only in cell culture but also in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients.”
In vitrostudies were conducted using neurons derived from a human cell line. Neurons cultured in this way possess many of the functions of cells in the brain. They form long branches that make connections with neighboring cells, move cargo through cells, and recycle cell waste. They may also be damaged by the same toxic elements that drive neurodegenerative disease, such as oxidative stress, which contributes to disease progression. In this way, these cell cultures are useful models of disease states.
4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is a naturally occurring molecule known to induce oxidative stress. 4-HNE is found in high levels in the brains of people with neurodegenerative diseases. When added to a culture of neurons in this study, cells began to die as soon as four hours after exposure to 4-HNE. By 24 hours, more than 50% of the cells had died. This was evident not only by the visual appearance of the culture, but also by an increase in levels of a structural protein called neurofilament light (NfL) that was released from dying neurons into the culture medium. However, when zervimesine was added with the 4-HNE to the cultures, cell viability was preserved, and cellular levels of NfL were also maintained, attesting to the structural integrity of the neurons.
Further study showed zervimesine was able to preserve cell integrity and function in the face of a toxic compound such as 4-HNE by interrupting 4-HNE’s ability to induce cell death.
Dr. Hamby concluded, “Cell death can be triggered through several processes, including apoptosis. Additional research will be needed to determine the precise point at which zervimesine prevents cell death under oxidative stress conditions. This neuroprotective mechanism may underlie the decrease in NfL that was observed in Alzheimer’s patients treated with zervimesine in the 6-month ‘SHINE’ Study of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease.”
These findings were presented at a recent Keystone Symposium and the posters are available on ourwebsite.
About Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative disorders of the central nervous system. We recently completed Phase 2 studies of our lead candidate, zervimesine (CT1812) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease and geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD. The Phase 2 START study (NCT05531656) in early Alzheimer’s disease is ongoing. We believe zervimesine can regulate pathways that are impaired in these diseases though its interaction with the sigma-2 receptor, a mechanism that is functionally distinct from other approaches for the treatment of degenerative diseases.

About Zervimesine (CT1812)Zervimesine (CT1812) is an investigational, oral, once-daily pill in development for the treatment of CNS diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). While these diseases have different symptoms, both are associated with the buildup of certain proteins in the brain – Aβ and ɑ-synuclein. As these proteins bind to neurons, they can damage and ultimately destroy the neurons. This results in a progressive loss in a person’s ability to learn, recall memories, move efficiently, or communicate. These diseases progress relentlessly and ultimately result in death. If zervimesine can interrupt the toxic effects of these proteins, it may be able to slow progression of disease and improve the lives of those suffering from Alzheimer’s and DLB. Zervimesine has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. Zervimesine has been granted FDA Fast Track designation in Alzheimer’s disease.
The USAN Council has adopted zervimesine as the United States Adopted Name (USAN) for CT1812.
About the SEQUEL StudyThe SEQUEL study (NCT04735536) enrolled 16 adults (15 of whom completed the study) with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE 18-26), each of whom were randomized to receive either 300mg CT1812 or placebo once daily for 29 days. After a 14-day wash-out period, participants cross over into the other treatment arm for an additional 29 days. Quantitative EEG evaluations were taken periodically throughout the duration of the trial. SEQUEL was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of CT1812 and to measure the impact of CT1812 on the electrical activity in the brain, specifically those electrical impulses in the theta band.
SEQUEL was supported by $5.3 million in grant awards (R01AG058710) by the National Institute of Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The START Study is being conducted with partners at the Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC), with $81 million in grant support from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health.
Christopher van Dyck, MD, stated, “This is an important milestone for the study and is a testament to the commitment of the investigators and site teams and a high level of interest from participants in an oral treatment with a novel approach to addressing amyloid in early Alzheimer’s disease.” Dr. Van Dyck is the director of the Yale Alzheimer’s Disease Research Unit and the Yale Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. He also serves as a member of the ACTC executive committee and is the project director of the START Study.
The START Study (NCT05531656) is designed to enroll up to 540 individuals with mild Alzheimer’s disease who will be treated with zervimesine (CT1812) or placebo for 18 months. Participants are being enrolled at approximately 50 sites in the United States, including premier institutions in the ACTC network. More information about this study may found athttps://start-study.org.
“Participants in the START Study are just beginning to show signs of cognitive loss,” statedAnthony O. Caggiano, MD, PhD, Cognition’s CMO and head of R&D. “Based on our experience from the Phase 2 ‘SHINE’ Study in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease, we expect that patients with less disease pathology may experience the most benefit from zervimesine treatment. We look forward to working with our colleagues at ACTC to understand more about zervimesine’s potential in patients across the spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease.”
In the Phase 2 SHINE Study (NCT03507790), once-daily oral zervimesine treatment slowed cognitive decline by 38% compared to placebo. Participants with lower levels of the protein, p-tau217 in their blood plasma had a more robust treatment response, experienced a 95% slowing of their cognitive decline. Lower levels of p-tau217 may identify people who have not yet sustained severe neuronal loss, offering them a greater potential for treatment response.

Cognition Therapeutics,Cognition Therapeutics Presents Data at AAIC Highlighting Broad Neurological Impact of Zervimesine (CT1812) in Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Alzheimer’s Disease,https://ir.cogrx.com/press_releases/cognition-therapeutics-presents-data-at-aaic-highlighting-broad-neurological-impact-of-zervimesine-ct1812-in-dementia-with-lewy-bodies-and-alzheimers-disease/,"July 29, 2025 07:30 ET",N/A,saved_sites\cognition_ther_htmls\13.html,saved_sites\congition_ther_pdfs\Cognition Therapeutics Presents Data at AAIC Highlighting Br.pdf,"– Zervimesine’s impact on debilitating DLB behavioral symptoms highlighted in podium presentation –– Plasma p-tau217 levels can identify Alzheimer’s patients most likely to benefit from zervimesine treatment –– Plasma and CSF biomarkers support zervimesine’s impact on Alzheimer’s disease biology –
PURCHASE, N.Y., July  29, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., (the Company or Cognition) (NASDAQ: CGTX), a clinical stage company developing drugs that treat neurodegenerative disorders, presented results from the Phase 2 COG1201 SHIMMER study (NCT05225415) of zervimesine (CT1812) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC 2025).
As previously reported, the SHIMMER study met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability. Results showed that zervimesine treatment had a positive impact across neuropsychiatric, cognitive, motor, and functional scales. After six months of treatment, DLB patients treated with zervimesine scored an average of 86% better than placebo-treated patients on the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI-12). This tool measures 12 separate behavioral symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and anxiety, which are hallmarks of DLB. The findings were presented by James E. Galvin, MD, MPH during a Featured Research Session on July 29, 2025.
“Among the NPI-12 components, hallucinations, delusions, and anxiety are often considered most troubling to patients and their care partners,” stated Dr. Galvin, director of the Comprehensive Center for Brain Health at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the SHIMMER study director. “These behavioral symptoms are also some of the most challenging to treat, since DLB patients have severe and sometimes dangerous reactions to many commonly used neuropsychiatric drugs. This made zervimesine’s impact even more notable.”
Results from the Phase 2 COG0201 ‘SHINE’ study (NCT03507790) of zervimesine in Alzheimer’s disease were also presented at AAIC. The SHINE study met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability. An analysis was conducted on a subgroup of participants whose Alzheimer’s disease brain pathology was less pronounced, as determined by lower levels of a protein called p-tau217 in their blood. Approximately half of this subgroup was identified as having mild Alzheimer’s disease and half with moderate Alzheimer’s disease by the mini mental state exam (MMSE). The MMSE is a standard test that measures memory, attention, language and other functions to evaluate the degree of a person’s cognitive impairment.
SHINE participants with lower p-tau217 had a more robust response to zervimesine compared to those with higher p-tau217 levels regardless of their MMSE scores. Zervimesine was shown to arrest further cognitive deterioration in people with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s disease by 129% and 91%, respectively. Anthony Caggiano, MD, PhD, Cognition’s CMO and head of R&D, explained, “This was an important finding as we now know we can identify patients who are more likely to benefit from zervimesine treatment through a simple blood test for p-tau217.”
Additionally, two research posters delve into the mechanism that underlies the impact of zervimesine in Alzheimer’s disease. These posters summarize analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers from SHINE participants with lower levels of p-tau217. In these individuals, significant reductions were observed in the level of plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a protein associated with neuroinflammation. In addition, there were trends towards the normalization of neurofilament light (NfL), a protein associated with neurodegeneration, and amyloid beta species (Aβ40 and 42).
“The biomarker evidence we’re presenting at AAIC shows that zervimesine treatment had an effect on proteins involved in neuroinflammation, synapse health and neurodegeneration,” added Mary Hamby, PhD, VP of research. “This is consistent with previously reported results showing significant decreases in NfL and normalizing trends in amyloid beta species in the CSF of people treated with zervimesine. This is encouraging evidence that zervimesine is impacting the underlying Alzheimer’s disease biology.”
Dr. Galvin’s slide presentation and Cognition’s three posters will be available on theCognition Therapeutics websitein accordance with the conference’s embargo policy.
About the SHIMMER Study in Dementia with Lewy BodiesThe SHIMMER study (COG1201;NCT05225415) is an exploratory double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that enrolled 130 adults with mild-to-moderate DLB, who were randomized to either daily oral doses of zervimesine (100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo for six months. A total of 88 participants were randomized to the two treatment arms and 42 to the placebo arm. Assessments were conducted throughout the study using a number of tools, including the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to measure changes in hallucinations, anxiety and delusions; the Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation (CAF) to measure the frequency and duration of cognitive fluctuations; the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Cognitive Drug Research Battery (CDR), which track cognitive performance; and the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, an objective assessment of parkinsonism.
The SHIMMER study is supported by a grant award from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling approximately $30 million (R01AG071643) and was conducted in collaboration with James E. Galvin, MD, MPH, director of the Comprehensive Center for Brain Health at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA).
About the SHINE Study in Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer’s DiseaseThe SHINE study (NCT03507790) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 signal-finding trial that enrolled 153 adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease who were evenly randomized to receive either placebo or one of two doses of CT1812 (100 mg or 300 mg), which was taken orally daily for six months. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. The key secondary endpoint of cognition was ADAS-Cog 11. Exploratory endpoints included change in MMSE, ADAS-Cog 13, ADCS-ADL and -CGIC as well as pre-specified subgroup analyses included a comparison of cognitive and functional changes in participants with plasma p-tau217 levels above and below the median.
The SHINE study was supported by two grant awards from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling approximately $30 million.
About Zervimesine (CT1812)Zervimesine (CT1812) is an investigational, oral, once-daily pill in development for the treatment of CNS diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). While these diseases have different symptoms, both are associated with the buildup of certain proteins in the brain – Aβ and ɑ-synuclein. As these proteins bind to neurons, they can damage and ultimately destroy the neurons. This results in a progressive loss in a person’s ability to learn, recall memories, move efficiently, or communicate. These diseases progress relentlessly and ultimately result in death. If zervimesine can interrupt the toxic effects of these proteins, it may be able to slow progression of disease and improve the lives of those suffering from Alzheimer’s and DLB. Zervimesine has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. Zervimesine has been granted FDA Fast Track designation in Alzheimer’s disease.
The USAN Council has adopted zervimesine as the United States Adopted Name (USAN) for CT1812.
About Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative disorders of the central nervous system and retina. We currently are investigating our lead candidate, zervimesine (CT1812), inclinical programsin dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer’s disease, including the ongoing START study (NCT05531656) in early Alzheimer’s disease.

The START Study is enrolling approximately 540 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease who will be treated with zervimesine (CT1812) or placebo for 18 months. Cognition is conducting the study in collaboration with the Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC) with funding from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health.
“We believe the strong enrollment pace in the START Study is due to interest on the part of patients and investigators in the potential of a convenient, once-daily oral medication,” statedLisa Ricciardi, Cognition’s president and CEO. “The START Study is our largest Phase 2 trial to date and our second in Alzheimer’s disease. In 2024 we reported results from the SHINE Study in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease, which showed zervimesine slows cognitive deterioration in patients with lower levels of p-tau217. In the START study, we are testing zervimesine in people at earlier stages of disease progression. We look forward to building an understanding of zervimesine’s potential across the Alzheimer’s spectrum.”
About the START StudyThe START Study (NCT05531656) is designed to measure the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily oral zervimesine in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early Alzheimer’s disease who have elevated Aβ, as measured by PET or CSF. Participants are randomized to receive zervimesine or placebo for 18 months. The study will assess cognition and executive function using validated tools including the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and ADAS-Cog rating scales, as well as biomarker and safety findings.
The START Study is supported by an $81 million grant from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (R01AG065248). The study is being conducted in collaboration with the Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC), an NIA-funded (grant number U24AG057437) clinical trial network of 35 leading academic sites with expertise in clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease.

– Applications for IND and Breakthrough Status Filed for Dementia with Lewy Bodies –
PURCHASE, N.Y., June  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., (the Company or Cognition) (NASDAQ: CGTX), a clinical stage company developing drugs that treat neurodegenerative disorders, announced that the company will conduct an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on July 9, 2025. During the meeting, the Cognition team will review results of the Phase 2 ‘SHINE’ study (NCT03507790) of zervimesine (CT1812) in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, proposed plans for a Phase 3 program designed to support regulatory approval of zervimesine in this patient population will be discussed with the FDA.
“We believe we have a compelling proposal to advance zervimesine into a Phase 3 registrational program for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease,” statedLisa Ricciardi, Cognition’s president and CEO. “In parallel we are moving ahead with DLB and formulating plans to conduct a registrational program. Based on the positive Phase 2 ‘SHIMMER’ study (NCT05225415) results in DLB, we submitted an application to be considered for breakthrough therapy designation along with the investigational new drug (IND) application.”
Breakthrough therapy designation is designed by the FDA to expedite the development and regulatory review of promising therapies for serious or life-threatening conditions where preliminary clinical evidence suggests substantial improvement over existing treatments. The designation facilitates more intensive FDA guidance, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and eligibility for rolling submission and priority review. The FDA typically reviews applications for breakthrough designation within 60 days.
The expanded access program (EAP) for zervimesine in DLB is progressing with high interest among former SHIMMER participants. The EAP is enrolling adults with DLB who participated in the SHIMMER study, as well as others who meet the program’s eligibility criteria. While one site is currently open, the Cognition team is working closely with other sites to complete onboarding so that they may be open to patients soon.

PURCHASE, N.Y., July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., (the Company or Cognition) (NASDAQ: CGTX), a clinical stage company developing drugs that treat neurodegenerative disorders, announced that James E. Galvin, MD, MPH will present results from the Phase 2 ‘SHIMMER’ study of zervimesine (CT1812) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) during an oral presentation at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC). Dr. Galvin is director of the Comprehensive Center for Brain Health at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and was the COG1201 SHIMMER study (NCT05225415) director. The presentation will take place on July 29, 2025 in the 8:00 a.m. ET Featured Research Session.
“The results of the Phase 2 SHIMMER study give hope to the millions of people living with DLB and their healthcare teams, who struggle to treat this complex disease,” stated Dr. Galvin. “My colleagues and I believe that there is great potential in a once-daily oral medication that slows disease progress while simultaneously reducing the severity and frequency of some of the most troublesome symptoms of DLB.”
DLB is the second most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 1.4 million Americans. People living with DLB experience a variety of symptoms, which typically include neuropsychiatric features such as hallucinations, delusions and agitation; cognitive impairment; Parkinsonian movement disorders; REM sleep behavior disorder; and fluctuations in attention and awareness. Currently no disease-modifying therapeutics are approved for DLB.
Anthony Caggiano, MD, PhD, Cognition’s CMO and head of R&D added, “Zervimesine’s broad neuroprotective mechanism is illustrated by the favorable results observed in the Phase 2 SHIMMER study in DLB. In the SHIMMER study, zervimesine treatment slowed the progression of DLB’s diverse symptomology, with a meaningful impact on neuropsychiatric, motor, functional, and cognitive measures. Results from the Phase 2 ‘SHINE’ study in people with Alzheimer’s disease add further evidence to zervimesine’s neuroprotective properties. We look forward to presenting results from both studies at AAIC.”
The SHINE study was a signal-finding trial that showed zervimesine treatment preserved cognitive and functional abilities better than placebo in people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. This impact was more robust in participants with lower levels of p-Tau217, who experienced a 95% slowing of cognitive decline at six months as measured by ADAS-Cog 11 compared to placebo. Cognition will present clinical efficacy results and new proteomic findings from this Alzheimer’s study at AAIC.
Dr. Galvin’s slide presentation as well as Cognition’s three posters will be available on theCognition Therapeutics websitein accordance with the conference’s embargo policy.
About the SHIMMER Study in Dementia with Lewy BodiesThe SHIMMER study (COG1201;NCT05225415) is an exploratory double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that enrolled 130 adults with mild-to-moderate DLB, who were randomized to either daily oral doses of zervimesine (100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo for six months. A total of 88 participants were randomized to the two treatment arms and 42 to the placebo arm. Assessments were conducted throughout the study using a number of tools, including the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to measure changes in hallucinations, anxiety and delusions; the Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation (CAF) to measure the frequency and duration of cognitive fluctuations; the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Cognitive Drug Research Battery (CDR), which track cognitive performance; and the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, an objective assessment of parkinsonism.
The SHIMMER study is supported by a grant award from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling approximately $30 million (R01AG071643) and was conducted in collaboration with James E. Galvin, MD, MPH, director of the Comprehensive Center for Brain Health at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA).
About the SHINE Study in Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer’s DiseaseThe SHINE study (NCT03507790) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 signal-finding trial that enrolled 153 adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease who were evenly randomized to receive either placebo or one of two doses of CT1812 (100 mg or 300 mg), which was taken orally daily for six months. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. The key secondary endpoint of cognition was ADAS-Cog 11. Exploratory endpoints included change in MMSE, ADAS-Cog 13, ADCS-ADL and -CGIC as well as pre-specified subgroup analyses included a comparison of cognitive and functional changes in participants with plasma p-tau217 levels above and below the median.
The SHINE study was supported by two grant awards from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling approximately $30 million.
About Zervimesine (CT1812)Zervimesine (CT1812) is an investigational, oral, once-daily pill in development for the treatment of CNS diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). While these diseases have different symptoms, both are associated with the buildup of certain proteins in the brain – Aβ and ɑ-synuclein. As these proteins bind to neurons, they can damage and ultimately destroy the neurons. This results in a progressive loss in a person’s ability to learn, recall memories, move efficiently, or communicate. These diseases progress relentlessly and ultimately result in death. If zervimesine can interrupt the toxic effects of these proteins, it may be able to slow progression of disease and improve the lives of those suffering from Alzheimer’s and DLB. Zervimesine has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. Zervimesine has been granted FDA Fast Track designation in Alzheimer’s disease.
The USAN Council has adopted zervimesine as the United States Adopted Name (USAN) for CT1812.
About Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative disorders of the central nervous system and retina. We currently are investigating our lead candidate, zervimesine (CT1812), inclinical programsin dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer’s disease, including the ongoing START study (NCT05531656) in early Alzheimer’s disease. We believe zervimesine and our pipeline of σ-2 receptor modulators can regulate pathways that are impaired in these diseases that are functionally distinct from other approaches for the treatment of degenerative diseases.

PURCHASE, N.Y., Aug.  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., (the Company or Cognition) (NASDAQ: CGTX), a clinical-stage company developing drugs that treat neurodegenerative disorders, received final minutes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pertaining to the end-of-Phase 2 meeting that was conducted on July 9, 2025. FDA confirmed the proposed design of the Phase 3 program may support a New Drug Application (NDA) filing for zervimesine (CT1812) as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.
Based on the FDA’s feedback, the Phase 3 program is expected to enroll adults with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease who have lower levels of p-tau217 at screening.Previous clinical experience* has shown that zervimesine can arrest cognitive deterioration in this population by 95% compared to placebo. This degree of cognitive preservation in zervimesine-treated patients supports plasma p-tau217 as a predictive biomarker of robust treatment effect. Screening for p-tau217 levels in Phase 3 will therefore enrich the study population with patients most likely to benefit from zervimesine treatment.
“In the meeting minutes, FDA concurred with our plan to enrich the Phase 3 study population with Alzheimer’s patients who have lower p-tau217,” statedAnthony Caggiano, MD, PhD, Cognition’s CMO and head of R&D. “Because p-tau217 can be measured by a simple blood test, we expect this strategy will ease the burden on patients. This enrichment strategy may increase the power of the study and reduce trial costs.”
Participants will be randomized to either 100mg of oral zervimesine or placebo daily for six months. Efficacy and safety will be assessed, with endpoints affirmed by the FDA in the meeting minutes. Cognition also plans to include biomarker and imaging assessments in the Phase 3 program to support the clinical outcomes. Participants who complete either study will be eligible to enroll in an open-label extension study.
“Based on the end-of-Phase 2 meeting minutes, we are aligned with the FDA on a registrational plan for zervimesine that includes details of study enrichment, treatment duration, endpoints, and availability of an open-label extension,” statedLisa Ricciardi, president and CEO of Cognition. “One of the most important outcomes from the meeting was the FDA’s view that two six-month Phase 3 studies could support a new drug application for zervimesine. This plan allows us to enroll faster, more cost-effective studies, and brings us to a regulatory filing sooner. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the FDA as we propel zervimesine forward.”
* Results from the Phase 2 “SHINE” study in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease showed that participants treated with zervimesine who had lower plasma p-tau217 levels experienced a 95% slowing of cognitive decline as measured by ADAS-Cog11 when compared with placebo.

About the SHINE StudyTheCOG0201 ‘SHINE’ Studywas a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study that enrolled 153 adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The study met its primary endpoints of safety and tolerability. Changes in cognition (ADAS-Cog 11, cognitive composite and MMSE) and function (ADCS-ADL and ADCS-CGIC) were also measured. Participants were evenly randomized to receive either placebo or one of two doses of CT1812 (100 mg or 300 mg), which was taken orally daily for six months.

About Zervimesine (CT1812)Zervimesine(CT1812) is an investigational, oral, once-daily pill in development for the treatment of CNS diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). While these diseases have different symptoms, both are associated with the buildup of certain proteins in the brain – Aβ and ɑ-synuclein. As these proteins bind to receptors on the surface of neurons, they can damage and ultimately destroy the neurons. This results in a progressive loss in a person’s ability to learn, recall memories, move efficiently, or communicate. These diseases progress relentlessly and ultimately result in death. Zervimesine has been shown to interrupt the toxic effects of Aβ and ɑ-synuclein, which may slow progression of disease and improve the lives of those suffering from Alzheimer’s and DLB. Zervimesine has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date.
The USAN Council has adopted zervimesine as the United States Adopted Name (USAN) for CT1812.
About the SHINE StudyTheCOG0201 ‘SHINE’ Studywas a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study that enrolled 153 adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The study met its primary endpoints of safety and tolerability. Changes in cognition (ADAS-Cog 11, cognitive composite and MMSE) and function (ADCS-ADL and ADCS-CGIC) were also measured. Participants were evenly randomized to receive either placebo or one of two doses of CT1812 (100 mg or 300 mg), which was taken orally daily for six months.
The SHINE Study was supported by two grant awards from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling approximately $30 million. More information may be found at clinicaltrials.gov under trial IDNCT03507790.
About Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative disorders of the central nervous system. We recently completed Phase 2 studies of our lead candidate, zervimesine (CT1812) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease and geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD. The Phase 2 START study (NCT05531656) in early Alzheimer’s disease is ongoing with $81 million in grant support from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health. We believe zervimesine can regulate pathways that are impaired in these diseases though its interaction with the sigma-2 receptor, a mechanism that is functionally distinct from other approaches for the treatment of degenerative diseases.

Reduction in Biomarker Accumulation”... Study Published in

SCIE-Level Journal International Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS)
GemVax & KAEL Co., Ltd.

(082270, hereafter GemVax) announced on the 5th that a study confirming the

preventive effects of GV1001 on periodontitis, periodontitis-related

atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease was published in the International

Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS/IF 5.6).
According to Gemvax, the

paper titled ‘hTERT Peptide Fragment GV1001 Prevents the Development of Porphyromonas

gingivalis-Induced Periodontal Disease and Systemic Disorders in ApoE-Deficient

Mice’ was published in IJMS on the 1st. This study builds on prior research,

""Inhibition of the Severity of Periodontitis and Periodontitis-associated

Vascular Lipid Deposition by GV1001 in Animal Models,"" which was published

in August of last year. The lead author is Professor Emeritus No-hee Park of

UCLA’s Dental School, along with eight other researchers.
Periodontitis affects

approximately 10 to 15% of the global adult population and has been identified

as a risk factor for diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and dementia,

in addition to tooth loss.
The main outcomes of this

research highlight GV1001's therapeutic and preventive potential in treating

periodontitis, periodontitis-induced atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease.
The study indicated that

administering GV1001 to mice with periodontitis induced by Porphyromonas

gingivalis (Pg) and lacking apolipoprotein E (ApoE) helped suppress both

periodontal disease and vascular inflammation. Notably, it was observed that

GV1001 reduced the buildup of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers.
The researchers emphasized,

“GV1001 demonstrated a preventive effect against atherosclerosis by reducing

vascular inflammation, lowering total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein

(LDL) levels, and reducing the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau, key

biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.” They concluded, “This suggests that GV1001

has therapeutic and preventive effects on Alzheimer’s disease in patients with

periodontitis.”
A GemVax representative

commented, “Given the established relationship between periodontitis and

Alzheimer’s disease, the study’s confirmation that GV1001 reduces amyloid-beta

and tau accumulation in a periodontitis-induced animal model is a highly positive

signal for developing GV1001 as an Alzheimer’s treatment. We will continue to

conduct further studies to demonstrate GV1001's therapeutic and preventive

potential.”
In addition to these

findings, Gemvax is actively engaged in preclinical and clinical trials to

validate the diverse effects of GV1001, such as anti-aging, anti-oxidation, and

anti-inflammation. The company is efficiently advancing preclinical trials for

multiple indications associated with the new drug, alongside a global phase 2

clinical trial aimed at developing a treatment for Alzheimer's disease in the

US and Europe, and a domestic phase 2 clinical trial for progressive

supranuclear palsy.

Regulatory Milestone

Builds Upon Previous FDA Orphan Drug Designation and Positions Company for

Accelerated Global Development Timeline
GemVax & KAEL (KOSDAQ:

082270) announced on May 7 that the United States Food and Drug Administration

(FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to GV1001, the company’s

investigational therapeutic candidate for the treatment of progressive

supranuclear palsy (PSP).
The FDA Fast Track designation

is a regulatory pathway established to facilitate the development and expedite

the review process for investigational drugs that address serious medical

conditions with significant unmet medical needs. This designation enables

enhanced regulatory guidance and streamlined approval processes to accelerate

patient access to potentially life-changing therapies.
This regulatory milestone

represents the second significant FDA recognition of GV1001’s therapeutic potential,

following the agency’s grant of Orphan Drug Designation on May 2, 2025. The

combination of these designations positions GemVax to leverage comprehensive

regulatory incentives throughout the continued development of its PSP treatment

program.
The Fast Track designation

provides GemVax with several strategic advantages in the development of GV1001,

including enhanced FDA communication channels to optimize clinical trial design

and ensure appropriate data collection methodologies for regulatory submission.

The designation also enables rolling review procedures, which permit the

submission of completed sections of regulatory applications as they become available,

thereby reducing overall review timelines.
The compound continues to

benefit from its previously granted Orphan Drug status, which provides

substantial financial incentives including tax credits of up to 25% on

qualified clinical trial expenses, exemption from FDA new drug application

fees, and seven years of market exclusivity upon successful commercialization.
These combined regulatory

advantages are anticipated to significantly enhance the global clinical

development timeline for GV1001.
GemVax has established a robust

clinical foundation for GV1001 through the successful completion of Korea's

inaugural Phase 2 clinical trial in PSP patients. The study demonstrated

favorable tolerability profiles while indicating potential efficacy in slowing

disease progression. Building upon these encouraging results, the company is

advancing preparations for a comprehensive global Phase 3 clinical trial

program.
Progressive supranuclear palsy

represents a rare and devastating form of atypical parkinsonism characterized

by progressive deterioration in balance, ocular motility, speech, and cognitive

function. While sharing certain clinical features with Parkinson's disease, PSP

demonstrates a significantly more rapid progression rate and poses substantial

challenges for patient management. The absence of disease-modifying therapeutic

options represents a critical unmet medical need within the neurological

community.
GV1001 is a synthetically

derived peptide compound based on the amino acid sequence information of human

telomerase. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the compound's diverse

biological activities, including antioxidant capabilities and cytoprotective

effects. Of particular relevance to neurodegeneration, GV1001 has shown

potential to modulate the brain's inflammatory microenvironment and attenuate

pathological immune responses, positioning it as a promising therapeutic

candidate for neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and

PSP.

Green Light for World's First New Drug Development
﻿
GemVax & KAEL Co., Ltd.

(GemVax, 082270) announced on the 13th that the U.S. Food and Drug

Administration (FDA) approved their Investigational New Drug (IND) application

for a Phase 2 clinical trial of GV1001, aimed at treating progressive

supranuclear palsy (PSP), onFebruary9 (local time).
With this approval, GemVax's

global development of GV1001 for PSP is now fully underway. PSP currently has

no cure and is classified as one of the Parkinsonian syndromes due to its

similarities to Parkinson’s disease. However, PSP progresses more rapidly and

responds poorly to existing Parkinson’s treatments, underscoring the urgency

for new therapies.
GemVax plans to evaluate the

efficacy and safety of GV1001 in this trial, where either 0.56 mg or 1.12 mg of

the drug will be administered subcutaneously to 150 PSP patients over 12 months

across 30-40 medical institutions. The company also intends to seek approval

from regulatory bodies in the UK and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the

near future.
The company has already

initiated clinical trials for PSP in Korea. As of June, 59 patients (79% of the

target) have been enrolled, and the trials are progressing smoothly.
Preclinical trials of GV1001

have demonstrated statistically significant improvements in motor and spatial

cognitive functions, as well as the inhibition of tau protein damage associated

with PSP. GV1001, composed of human telomerase-derived peptides, has also shown

anti-aging, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Following its

successful Phase 2 trials for Alzheimer’s disease, GemVax expects similarly

positive results from the ongoing domestic and international PSP trials.
A GemVax representative

commented, ""GV1001 has been shown to improve the immune environment in the

brain and reduce inflammation. Building on our success in Korea, and with

international regulatory bodies now confirming its therapeutic potential, we

are dedicating all our efforts to establishing GV1001 as the world’s first

treatment for PSP.""
Additionally, GemVax has

applied for orphan drug designation for GV1001 in Korea after receiving a

recommendation from the Korea Orphan & Essential Drug Center. If the

domestic Phase 2 trial demonstrates efficacy, the company plans to pursue

conditional approval for commercialization. They will also seek orphan drug

Attends 7th TIC-PDMD… “95% Delay in Disease

Progression in PSP-RS Patients
GemVax & KAEL Co., Ltd.

(hereinafter “GemVax,” KOSDAQ: 082270) announced the topline results of its

Phase 2a clinical trial for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) through a

poster presentation at an international academic conference.
According to GemVax, the company

participated in the 7th Taiwan International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease

and Movement Disorders (7th TIC-PDMD) held in Taipei, Taiwan, fromNovember22

to 24, where it presented the phase 2a clinical data on its PSP treatment

candidate, GV1001.
TIC-PDMD, hosted biennially by

the Taiwan Movement Disorder Society (TMDS), serves as a platform for sharing

innovative research findings and novel therapeutic approaches in

neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson’s disease and movement

disorders.
Through the poster

presentation, GemVax reported that the Phase 2a trial results demonstrated that

the group receiving GV1001 (0.56 mg) experienced a 48% delay in disease

progression compared to the placebo group. Moreover, when analyzing only

PSP-Richardson Syndrome (PSP-RS) patients, who account for approximately 75% of

PSP cases, the disease progression delay
These findings were first

presented at Neuro2024, held in Toronto, Canada, last October. At the time,

global experts highly praised the observed trend of GV1001 compared to the

placebo group, as well as the drug’s safety profile.
Professor Ji-young Lee, the

principal investigator of the study and a professor in the Department of

Neurology at Seoul National University College of Medicine, who also practices

at Boramae Hospital in Seoul (operated by Seoul National University Hospital),

stated, “In this clinical trial, GV1001 (0.56 mg) demonstrated clinically

meaningful benefits even with short-term treatment. Moving forward, we will

conduct a thorough analysis of all available data to ensure that this research

leads to a treatment that genuinely benefits patients.”
Building on its multi-mechanism

approach, GemVax is advancing the development of GV1001 as a PSP treatment

following its Alzheimer’s disease program. The company is actively preparing

for a global Phase 3 clinical trial for PSP.
A GemVax representative stated,

“Following our presentation at Neuro2024, our findings have once again drawn

significant attention and positive feedback from leading global experts at this

conference. With strong interest from both academia and the industry, we will

continue to share our PSP research progress at international conferences.”
Meanwhile, GemVax is currently

conducting a global Phase 2 trial for Alzheimer’s disease across seven

countries in the U.S. and Europe. The company expects to complete patient

dosing in the first half of next year and subsequently confirm the results.

Regulatory Milestone

Advances Global Clinical Development Program and Enhances Prospects for

First-in-Class PSP Therapeutic
﻿
GemVax & KAEL Co., Ltd.

(KOSDAQ: 082270, “GemVax”) announced on May 2 that the United States Food and

Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to GV1001,

the company’s investigational therapeutic candidate for the treatment for

progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The designation provides access to

comprehensive FDA support programs, which are anticipated to enhance

developmental efficiency and accelerate the advancement toward what may become

the first approved therapeutic intervention for PSP globally.
The FDA's Orphan Drug

Designation program was established to incentivize the development of

treatments for rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the

United States. The designation confers multiple regulatory and commercial

advantages, including tax credits of up to 25% on qualifying clinical trial

expenditures, waiver of New Drug Application fees, and seven years of market

exclusivity following regulatory approval.
The secured ODD status will

enable the company to leverage these regulatory incentives from the initiation

of this pivotal clinical phase. The designation follows the company's receipt

of development-stage orphan drug status from the Republic of Korea's Ministry

of Food and Drug Safety in the previous year.
GemVax has established a robust

clinical foundation for GV1001 through the successful completion of Korea's

inaugural Phase 2 clinical trial in PSP patients. The study demonstrated

favorable tolerability profiles while indicating potential efficacy in slowing

disease progression. Building upon these encouraging results, the company is

advancing preparations for a comprehensive global Phase 3 clinical trial

program.
Progressive supranuclear palsy

represents a rare and devastating form of atypical parkinsonism characterized

by progressive deterioration in balance, ocular motility, speech, and cognitive

function. While sharing certain clinical features with Parkinson's disease, PSP

demonstrates a significantly more rapid progression rate and poses substantial

challenges for patient management. The absence of disease-modifying therapeutic

options represents a critical unmet medical need within the neurological

community.
GV1001 is a synthetically

derived peptide compound based on the amino acid sequence information of human

telomerase. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the compound's diverse

biological activities, including antioxidant capabilities and cytoprotective

effects. Of particular relevance to neurodegeneration, GV1001 has shown

potential to modulate the brain's inflammatory microenvironment and attenuate

pathological immune responses, positioning it as a promising therapeutic

candidate for neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and

PSP.

ProfessorSeong-WoonYu's Team

Presents Poster at the American Society of Microbiology:
“GV1001 Enhances

Microglial Migration and Induces Phagocytosis”
﻿
Research findings reveal

that when GV1001 was administered to mice with moderate Alzheimer’s disease,

amyloid beta levels were reduced to normal, healthy levels.
The study demonstrated that

GV1001 promotes the movement of microglia—brain cells that act as cleaners—and

induces phagocytosis, facilitating the removal of amyloid beta, which is known

to be harmful to the brain.
On the 30th, GemVax &

KAEL Co., Ltd. (hereinafter GemVax, 082270) announced that Professor Seong-Woon

Yu's team at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST)

presented a poster detailing the results of their study on GV1001's mechanism

for amyloid beta clearance at the ""ReThink Neuroimmunology Symposium

2024,"" held at the University of Washington on the 26th (local time).
The study found that GV1001

enhances the clearance of amyloid beta by promoting microglial migration toward

amyloid plaques and inducing phagocytosis. Notably, the research team observed

that this microglial activity activates a signaling pathway (mTORC2) that

regulates proteins involved in cell survival and the cell cycle, further

facilitating the removal of amyloid plaques.
In conclusion, the study

confirmed that GV1001 not only reduces amyloid plaques in the brain but also

delays memory decline and neuronal damage in an Alzheimer's disease mouse

model.
Professor Yu commented,

“GV1001 has the potential to be a treatment that alleviates Alzheimer's

symptoms while also slowing or halting disease progression.” He added, “These

findings provide new hope for Alzheimer’s treatment and represent a significant

breakthrough in dementia research. We plan to continue investigating GV1001 as

a treatment for Alzheimer's and further validate its specific mechanisms.”
A GemVax official remarked,

“This study reaffirms that GV1001 is a drug with the potential for

fundamentally treating Alzheimer’s disease. As GV1001 expands its indications

to include other neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear

palsy, we anticipate meaningful results from various studies, including

mechanism investigations and clinical trials.”
The ""ReThink

Neuroimmunology Symposium"" took place from the 25th to the 27th, gathering

experts from research institutes and the pharmaceutical industry to share a

wide range of research findings in the field of neuroimmunology.

PSP is an intractable Parkinson's syndrome, a

neurodegenerative disease with symptoms similar to Parkinson's, but with a

rapid progression and no fundamental cure. Key symptoms include gait

disturbance, postural instability, cognitive decline, eye movement disorders,

and sleep disturbances, and the cause of the disease is still unknown.
In October, GemVax presented topline results from its GV1001

Phase 2 clinical trial for PSP at the Neuro2024 conference held in Canada. The

company plans to conduct global Phase 3 clinical trial for PSP in due course.
About Phase 2a PSP Clinical Trial (NCT05819658)

Topline

supports moving to Phase 3 trial and shows
potential to develop GV1001as the

world’s first PSP treatment
GemVax & KAEL Co., Ltd. (“GemVax”; KOSDAQ

ticker: 082270) announced that topline results of a Phase 2a clinical trial (the

“Phase 2a PSP Clinical Trial”) of GV1001, an investigational peptide drug for

the treatment of progressive supranuclear palsy (“PSP”), were presented at “Neuro2024:

The PSP and CBD International Research Symposium” in Toronto, Canada, at 4:45

p.m. local time on 24thOctober.
PSP is a degenerative disease that, like

Parkinson’s disease, causes symptoms such as gait disturbances, early falls,

vertical gaze palsy, rigidity, tremors, and cognitive decline, but it

progresses faster and currently has no fundamental treatment. PSP is classified

into several types, including PSP-Richardson's syndrome (“PSP-RS”) and

PSP-parkinsonism (“PSP-P”). Compared to other types of PSP, the PSP-RS type

shows a greater accumulation of tau protein and affects larger areas, including

the cerebellum, dentate nucleus, pontine nuclei, frontal lobe, and parietal

lobe.
The Phase 2a PSP Clinical Trial was a 24-week,

randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective exploratory clinical

trial conducted in 78 patients with PSP at 5 centers in Korea. The participants

were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either placebo or GV1001 0.56 mg or GV1001

1.12 mg administered subcutaneously once weekly for the first 4 weeks (1

month), and then at 2-week intervals for 20 weeks (5 months) for a total of 24

weeks (6 months). Patients with both PSP-RS and PSP-P types were eligible to

participate in the study. Results showed higher benefits in the lower dose

group (0.56 mg), particularly in PSP-RS type patients.
The primary endpoint of the trial was change

from baseline in total score (calculated as the least-square mean using MMRM

method) of PSP-Rating Scale after 24 weeks of GV1001 administration, which

showed deterioration by 2.14 points in GV1001 0.56 mg dose group compared to

4.10 points in the placebo group, demonstrating a 48% reduction in disease

progression (see Figure 1). Although statistical significance was not

demonstrated, the results support the potential of GV1001 as a treatment of

PSP, a disease for which there is currently no cure, and the potential to

advance GV1001 into further clinical trials.
Figure 1. PSP-Rating

Scale Total Score (PSP-RS Type + PSP-P Type; LS mean using MMRM)
The clinically typical PSP is often referred to

as the PSP-RS type, which accounts for the majority of PSP patients. This type

progresses faster and has a shorter average survival time compared to other PSP

types. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with PSP-RS type only. The

change from baseline in PSP-Rating Scale total score mean (calculated using

simple average) at 24 weeks of GV1001 administration to PSP-RS type patients was

a deterioration by 0.25 points in the GV1001 0.56 mg dose group compared to a

deterioration by 5.19 points in the placebo group, demonstrating a 4.94-point

difference or a 95% reduction in disease progression (see Figure 2).
Many PSP-RS type patients in the treatment

group experienced symptom stabilization or even improvement during the clinical

period. When calculated as responder rate based on the percentage of patients

whose PSP Rating Scale scores improved or remained stable after six months of

treatment compared to baseline, 58.33% of PSP-RS type patients in the 0.56 mg

GV1001 group showed improvement or stabilization (see Figure3).
The safety profile of GV1001 in the Phase 2a

PSP Clinical Trial was consistent with prior safety data. GV1001 was generally

well-tolerated with no serious adverse events related to the drug reported.
Hyungsik Moon, CSO of GemVax, stated that

""this Phase 2a trial was an exploratory study to determine the optimal

dosage and find out how the peptide works on different subgroups. Although the

topline result did not achieve statistical significance, the evidence is strong

enough to consider moving forward to a pivotal trial and shows potential to

develop GV1001 as the world’s first treatment option for PSP.”
Experts at the Neuro2024 meeting welcomed the

results of the PSP trial as encouraging and expressed excitement for the drug

to enter a global Phase 3 clinical trial for further development.
“This pilot study was not fully powered and the

treatment duration with 6 months was short. Thus, statistically significant

confirmatory results could not be expected” said Peter Schüler, MD, Senior Vice

President of Drug Development at global CRO ICON. “Nonetheless, the observed

trends are very plausible and consistent in two domains: motor performance and

cognitive function, both favoring the lower dose group.”
“The trial identified the optimal dose, which

was one of the primary objectives of the Phase 2a study, and demonstrated

clinically meaningful benefits, namely full stabilization of the disease

compared to the placebo group,” said Dr. Schüler, adding “these topline results

provide a strong foundation for advancing to Phase 3.”
Dr. Günter U. Höglinger, Head of the Department

of Neurology, LMU Hospital, Munich, and a world-renowned expert in PSP,

commented: “very exciting Phase 2 level data with novel drug study with new

mechanisms of action. Data is preliminary but very promising and it is in line

with [GV1001] Alzheimer’s  disease

clinical data. I look forward to further development and very excited to

participate and lead the [PSP] Phase 3 study.”
Dr. Kristophe Diaz, Director of CurePSP, said that

“we are encouraged by the results of the recent GemVax clinical trial, which

offer hope to the entire PSP community, including patients who currently have

no treatment options, their families and the physicians who care for them” and

that “we congratulate GemVax on the successful completion of this trial and

look forward to further developments that benefit the PSP community.” He also

said that “CurePSP remains committed to collaborating and supporting efforts

that bring hope and progress for those affected by this devastating disease.”

Clinical Trials in the U.S. and 7 European Countries
– Targeting Completion in the

First Half of Next Year
﻿
GemVax & KAEL Co., Ltd.

(GemVax, 082270) announced on the 12th that it has successfully completed

patient recruitment for the global Phase 2 clinical trial of GV1001, its drug

for treating Alzheimer’s disease.
A total of 199 patients have

been enrolled in the trial—83 in the United States and 116 across seven

European countries, including Spain, the Netherlands, and Poland. The study is

evaluating the efficacy and safety of GV1001 administered subcutaneously at

doses of 0.56 mg or 1.12 mg over a 53-week period (12 months) in patients with

mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The primary efficacy measure is the

Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog).
Having received

Investigational New Drug (IND) approval from the U.S. Food and Drug

Administration (FDA), GemVax is conducting the trial at 43 institutions across

the U.S. and Europe.
Alzheimer’s disease, the

most common neurodegenerative disease causing dementia, disrupts communication

between nerve and glial cells, leading to inflammation, brain cell death, and a

decline in nerve cell function. This progressive damage ultimately results in

the loss of all daily life functions. While recent treatments have been

developed to slow disease progression and improve cognitive function, they

often come with significant side effects, leaving a high unmet need for safer

therapies.
GV1001 has demonstrated no

significant side effects or adverse reactions to date and has shown potential

as a multi-mechanism treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. It inhibits the

deposition of beta-amyloid and the aggregation of tau protein in nerve cells.

Moreover, recent studies have identified a novel mechanism by which GV1001

regulates microglia and astrocytes through its interaction with the

gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), adding further therapeutic

potential.
A GemVax official stated,

“Despite initial challenges in launching this global Phase 2 clinical trial

across eight countries, including the U.S., we are progressing smoothly and

have successfully completed patient recruitment. We remain fully committed to

ensuring that all patients complete treatment and look forward to delivering

final results that could help develop a safe and effective treatment for

Alzheimer’s disease.”
In addition to its

Alzheimer’s program, GemVax is developing a treatment for progressive

supranuclear palsy (PSP), another neurodegenerative and rare disease. The

company’s domestic Phase 2 clinical trial for PSP has already completed patient

recruitment, with full dosing expected by year-end. GemVax has also received

FDA approval for its PSP Phase 2 clinical trial plan and is preparing to submit

clinical trial applications in the UK and Europe as part of its global drug

development efforts.

Conditional Approval Application Planned if Clinical Efficacy is

Confirmed
﻿
GemVax & KAEL Co., Ltd.

(GemVax, 082270) announced on the 28th that it has completed patient

recruitment for the domestic Phase 2 clinical trial of GV1001, a treatment for

progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
This Phase 2 trial will

evaluate the efficacy and safety of GV1001 in 78 PSP patients over 6 months.

Participants are divided into three groups: a placebo group, and two treatment

groups receiving either 0.56 mg or 1.12 mg of GV1001. The trial is being conducted

at leading hospitals, including Boramae Hospital, Seoul National University

Hospital, Samsung Medical Center, Bundang Seoul National University Hospital,

and Kyung Hee University Hospital, with Professor Ji-young Lee of Seoul

National University Hospital serving as the principal investigator.
This marks Korea’s first

clinical trial for PSP. With the final patient enrolled, it is expected that

all patients will complete dosing by the end of September.
If the Phase 2 trial

demonstrates efficacy and safety, GemVax plans to apply for conditional product

approval and proceed with commercialization. GV1001 was designated as a 'development-stage

orphan drug' by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in February, expediting

the review process for conditional approval. Upon approval, the drug would also

be granted four years of market exclusivity.
PSP is an atypical

Parkinsonian syndrome characterized by a progressive inability to move the eyes

(supranuclear palsy), as well as gait disturbances, rigidity, tremors, and

cognitive decline. While its symptoms resemble those of Parkinson’s disease,

PSP progresses more rapidly and currently has no treatment. The condition is

pathophysiologically linked to Alzheimer’s disease, with neuroinflammation and

tau protein damage leading to neuronal cell death.
In preclinical trials using

TauP301L0BiFC mice, GV1001 demonstrated its ability to inhibit the

hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau proteins, improving both motor and

cognitive function. These promising results were highlighted at international

conferences. At the International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement

Disorders (MDS) in Denmark, the trial results were presented as a late-breaking

abstract. At Neuro2023, Dr. Günter U. Höglinger, a leading expert from

Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU), Munich, also recognized GV1001 as a new

multi-mechanism drug candidate for PSP.
In addition to the ongoing

trial, GemVax is conducting a 12-month extension study for patients who wish to

continue. In this single-group trial, all participants will receive 1.12 mg of

GV1001 for an additional 12 months, allowing GemVax to gather further data on

the long-term effects of the drug.
Global clinical trials for

PSP are also progressing. In February, the U.S. FDA approved GemVax’s Phase 2

clinical trial plan for PSP, and the company is preparing to launch similar

trials in Europe and the UK.
A GemVax official stated,

“PSP presents a high unmet medical need, with no current treatment available to

slow its progression or cure the disease. As we approach the completion of our

Phase 2 trial, we are nearing the commercialization of the world’s first PSP

treatment.”
GV1001, a telomerase-based

peptide, is a multi-mechanism drug with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and

anti-aging properties. It has been recognized as a disease-modifying treatment

for neurodegenerative diseases, not only alleviating symptoms but also improving

the immune environment in the brain and protecting nerve cells. In October of

last year and January of this year, additional data on GV1001's mechanism for

treating Alzheimer's disease and its anti-aging effects were disclosed, further

contributing to the growing body of evidence on its mechanism of action.

﻿
GemVax & KAEL Co., Ltd.

(GemVax, 082270) announced on the 23rd that its progressive supranuclear palsy

(PSP) treatment, 'GV1001,' was designated as a 'development-stage orphan drug'

by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety on the 22nd.
The orphan drug designation

system supports the expedited development and approval of treatments for rare

diseases. In Korea, it applies to medicines for conditions affecting fewer than

20,000 patients, where no current treatments exist, or where the new drug shows

greater safety and efficacy than existing options.
With orphan drug

designation, GV1001 is now eligible for the fast-track review process,

potentially allowing it to be marketed with ‘conditional approval’ after only

Phase 2 clinical trials.
This designation paves the

way for GemVax to apply for conditional approval upon confirmation of efficacy

in domestic Phase 2 trials. Other benefits include extended product license

validity and market exclusivity. GemVax also plans to pursue orphan drug status

overseas, including from the FDA.
PSP, a rapidly progressing

atypical Parkinson’s syndrome, is the most severe form of Parkinsonism with

limited treatment options, making the development of new therapies urgent.
GemVax is currently

conducting its first domestic Phase 2 clinical trial for PSP, having

successfully enrolled 66 patients (88% of target). Global efforts are also

advancing, with the U.S. FDA approving a Phase 2 clinical trial on the 9th(local time).
GV1001, a multi-mechanism

drug, acts on various telomerase functions and is expected to improve the

brain's immune environment and reduce inflammation in neurodegenerative

diseases like PSP and Alzheimer’s disease. In preclinical PSP trials, GV1001

showed statistically significant improvements in motor and spatial cognitive

functions and inhibited tau protein damage.
A GemVax official stated,

“This orphan drug designation will be invaluable in our efforts to develop the

world’s first PSP treatment. We are fully committed to delivering effective

treatments for PSP patients who currently have no options, through successful

domestic and global clinical trials.”
The global orphan drug

market is expanding rapidly. According to data from the Korea National

Enterprise for Clinical Trials (2023), the global orphan drug market is

expected to reach approximately $300 billion (₩398 trillion) by 2028. This

represents an average annual growth rate of 11.6%, significantly outpacing the

6.1% growth rate of the overall prescription drug market (excluding generics

and orphan drugs), which is projected to grow from $922 billion (₩1,225

trillion) to $1.24 trillion (₩1,647 trillion) during the same period.
