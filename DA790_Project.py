* Name: Lettie Unkrich
* Description: The program will scrape websites looking for articles related to alzheimer's, extract relevant data, and store it into
an excel spreadsheet. When gathering the data, it will firstly check if an API is available and convenient to use. If either condition
is false, the program will move on to using the Requests library with BeautifulSoup4, and only turn to Selenium if dynamic elements 
require it. Selenium will use the firfox driver.
* Input: The code requires the website urls to the news/press release home page.
* Output: A excel spreadsheet of the metadata collected from alzheimer related articles.

#                             WEEKLY NOTES, QUESTIONS, PROBLEMS AND LINKS
# ==========================================================================================
'''
Notes:

Questions:
- Would you like us to store every weeks version of our code file in the github repository, or can we overwrite a previous version?
- Is publisher the sponsor?
- What makes an api convienant? For available I have it checking to see if a status of 200 is returned.

Problems:
- FIXED: alzheon_inc_url just keeps loading main page in get_all_pages. Need something that analyzes if the names of links being recorded are already in all_links. If so, quit.
- adel_inc_url will not load if you do https://www.alzinova.com/investors/press-releases/?page=1 even though it follows the ?page=num standard
    - if you manually search by doing ?page=num it reloads home page, if you select next it goes to ?page=num.
- need to check api code, because every site returned an api is not available
- code takes a long time to run because some functions are only using selenium, and not using it as a last resort. I am in progress on fixing it.

Thoughts:
- When grabbing article links should I continue using generic functions or go straight to writing code for each site?
- Could I use bs_matches = 0 and sel_matches = 0 in find_alz_articles to decide if i need to use bs or sel for web scraping?
    - if bs_matches returns 0 it means only sel was used.
    - if so, remove bs code from get_adel_details
    - could even put bs_matches and sel_matches in an earlier function.
