'''
* Name: Lettie Unkrich
* Description: The program will scrape 100+ websites looking for articles related to alzheimer's, extract relevant data, and store it into
an excel spreadsheet. When gathering the data, it will firstly check if an API is available and convenient to use. If either condition
is false, the program will move on to using the Requests library with BeautifulSoup4, and only turn to Selenium if dynamic elements 
require it. 
* Input: The code requires the website urls to the news/press release home page.
* Output: A csv file of the metadata collected from alzheimer related articles.
